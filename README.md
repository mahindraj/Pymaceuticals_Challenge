### Overview

Pymaceuticals Inc is a new pharmaceutical company that specialises in anti-cancer medications. In this particular study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The analysis takes reference from 2 different sources of data (Mouse Data and Study Results). The task of this challenge is to generate all of the data via tables and figures needed for a techincal report of the clinical study to summarise the study results.


### Analysis

Overall, it comes down to three points:
1. Out of the 4 drug regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane show they tend to reduce the tumor size better
2. Out of the 4 drug regimens, Infubinol and Ceftamin show they tend to be the least effective for reducing tumor size
3. There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumuor volume at 0.84. It shows that as the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volumes increases as well
